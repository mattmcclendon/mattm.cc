# mattm.cc link index

This repository contains a lightweight link folksonomy powering short URLs under `mattm.cc`.

Each directory maps a stable, human-readable path to a canonical destination elsewhere on the web. The structure is intentional, minimal, and designed to age well.

## What This Is

- A personal redirect index
- A semantic shortcut layer
- Versioned, transparent infrastructure

Paths are treated as durable references, not campaigns or tracking links.

## What This Is Not

- A URL shortener service
- A marketing funnel
- A place for ephemeral or transactional links

If a destination is temporary, it does not belong here.

## Structure

Each folder represents a public-facing path and contains a simple redirect to its canonical destination.

Example:
- `/noise` → Amid the Noise
- `/papers` → Long-form essays and white papers
- `/github` → Source and technical work

## Philosophy

Short links are used here as wayfinding, not compression.  
Clarity beats cleverness. Stability beats novelty.
